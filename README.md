# GoLang Implementation of Distance Vector Routing Algorithm

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Network(router)-GoLang-informational?style=flat-square&logo=go&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a)

This project focuses on the implementation of a Distance Vector Routing algorithm in GoLang, with the following key features:

- **Simulation**: The algorithm is simulated using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for communication.

- **Terminal Interaction**: The project places a significant emphasis on terminal interactions, providing a command-line interface for user engagement.

- **Logging**: It's noteworthy that there are no explicit log files generated by the project. However, if logging is required, redirection within the Linux system can be utilized.

Feel free to explore and leverage this implementation for understanding and simulating the behavior of the Distance Vector Routing algorithm in a network environment. If necessary, refer to the Linux system's redirection capabilities for obtaining log information.
